## âšª Can you draw a circle? Really, can you?

### Let's check it with [circles.io](https://circles-io.vercel.app/)

## This project is created for nFactorial competition, but it's open source and you can use it in your own ways

### Tech-stack I used to create this project
- Next.js & Typescript
- Redux for state managment
- A lot of knowledge about canvas

### Formulas and math in this project
- I used trigonometry functions to calculate accuracy
- I used the same trigonomentry to calculate errors, especially with the problem of drawing close to the dot

### Bugs or what to fix
- Implement methods & functions to make able to draw on mobile phones (it's adaptive, but you can't draw yet)
- I need to create methods to check if the user is drawing complete circle
- I need to improve method of coloring line in red, because at the moment it's not working 100% correctly
- Need to separate all logic into hook.ts. I already created a file but due to time limit it's not separated yet

### You can simply visit the [deployment](https://circles-io.vercel.app/), or use steps below to run this project locally
